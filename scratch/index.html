  <h1>Frontend Masters Complete Intro To Web Dev Notes</h1>
  This is body text that I finally got working from a snippet!
  <h2>This is a subheading</h2>
  <h3>This is a sub sub heading</h3>
  <ol class="">
    <li>First list item</li>
    <li>Second list item</li>
    <li>Third list item</li>
  </ol>
  <input type="color" name="colorpick" value="" />
  <input type="radio" name="radiopick" value="" />
  <h3>Tables</h3>
  <p>This is how you write a table</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <td>Column 1</td>
      <td>Column 2</td>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <!-- This is an html code comment -->
  <marquee>This is the depreciated marquee tag!</marquee>
  <!-- Note that using the br tag is gross and people don't use it -->
  <h3>How to properly separate lines</h3>
  <p>You can break the paragraph into multiple paragraphs</p>
  <p>Like this</p>
  <p>
    You can also use the br tag <br />
    but nobody uses that anymore
  </p>
  <!-- Divs are nice, but assistive tech uses default tags to figure out what is on the page -->
  <!-- This is a quick comment I made by recording the worlds worst macro -->
  <h2>Attributes, Classes and Id's</h2>
  <h3>Classes</h3>
  <p class="the-blue-one">
    Classes can be used for lots of things including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Referring to the html block in code</li>
    <li>Telling the block what css style to use</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Organizing HTML</h2>
  <script src="./experiments.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
