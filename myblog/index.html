            I've spent the last couple of weeks effectively starting over with
            programming. It's been a frustrating experience. I've always
            preferred to do things my way. There's nothing wrong with that. My
            way is usually the way that gets me competent the fastest, longevity
            be damned. Sometimes though, when I feel like I really need to get
            good at something, I'll hunker down into a chrysallis and shed my
            poor habits and emerge from my coccoon as a much more competent
            individual.
