          So those of you who know me may not know this. Today is the day I
          come out and say it. I really like bees. Lets be real. They are
          really cool! I just had to let the world know.

          I've spent the last couple of weeks effectively starting over with
          programming. It's been a frustrating experience. I've always
          preferred to do things my way. There's nothing wrong with that. My
          way is usually the way that gets me competent the fastest, longevity
          be damned. Sometimes though, when I feel like I really need to get
          good at something, I'll hunker down into a chrysallis and shed my
          poor habits and emerge from my coccoon as a much more competent
          individual.

          I've often times had a hard time getting things done. I was
          diagnosed with ADHD not too long ago. This was an eye opener for me.
          I now knew why I had such a tough time getting things done. However,
          this knowledge did not help me get more done. Which I guess is the
          issue with learning you have a disability. Most of the work you have
          to do as the person with the disability is understanding what your
          limits are and being kinder to yourself. ADHD is a fortunate
          disability to have because the medication for it is very efficable.
          For me it feels like none of the options have been all that helpful.
          I think this is mostly because my body is unable to tollerate
          standard levels of the drug.

          I started Bits N Pixels a little over a year ago. I had started
          reading the garbage day newsletter and was inspired to start my own.
          I felt like I could use some self empowerment, and the easiest way
          to do that was just to write what was on my mind. I'm sad that I
          haven't been able to post to it as much as I would like. Especially
          when it comes to game reviews. I'm scared because I don't want game
          reviews to dillute what I've been writing. I do however, think that
          it would help the newsletter and my steam curator.
