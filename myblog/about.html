  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Hi!</p>
  <p>
    My name is Nick Pastoria! Welcome to my blog website. I'm a computer
    scientist and game designer from california! I've been programming for as
    long as I've had access to a computer.
  </p>
  <h4>Early Life</h4>
  <p>
    Around 2005 I got access to my first netbook at home and was allowed to
    play minecraft. From there I was creating mods, port forwarding my router,
    and hosting servers so all of my friends and I could play. I was
    interested in almost any subject I could get my hands on though. I
    remember wanting to be a 'renaissance man.' I learned photoshop and video
    editing. My friends and I made home movies that I edited together and
    burned onto CD's. I also learned how to solve a Rubicks cube at this time
    which would be one of my favorite pass-times for a while. I was fortunate
    enough that my school had an animation class where I learned how to make
    hand-drawn animations.
  </p>
  <h4>Highschool and Early College</h4>
  <p>
    In highschool I joined the robotics team but instead of programming I
    chose to be in design. Here I learned 3D modelling and CAD. I still
    programmed, just not for robots. I wish my path could have been simple,
    but sometimes that's not how things roll. When choosing what college to go
    to I really wanted to go to Santa Cruz's school of Computer Science and
    Game Design. My family was not as sold on the program. I filled out
    applications and a few months later I was accepted to CSUN's school of
    mechanical enineering. I stayed there for a full year, and even got an
    aerospace internship after just one semester! Something just felt wrong. I
    felt like I wasn't in the right space. In my free time at home, and at
    work I found myself programming whenever I got the chance. At work I
    learned visual basic so I could make games in Excel when I ran out of work
    to do so it didn't look like I was goofing off. My computer was pointed
    right at the big shiny glass door of the CFO's office. One day he
    complimented by work ethic while I sat there working on a game. At home I
    was making articficial life simulations in Game Maker.
  </p>
  <h4>Community College and Tempest Freerunning</h4>
  <p>
    I stayed at the internship for about seven or eight months until it was
    clear I had overstayed my welcome. Sometime during my internship I picked
    up a life lesson that forever changed the way I made decisions. I was
    raised to be "smart." So I always made the choice that made the most
    sense, but I felt like I wasn't living "my" life. So I started living life
    based on this mentre: "When making a tough decision assign your two
    options to the sides of a coin. Flip the coin, and before you see the
    result you already know which one you want more." I dropped out of CSUN
    and transferred to my local community college to get my associates in
    computer science. Well... community college took me a lot longer than I
    expected. I worked on many cool personal projects while I was there. I ran
    simulations of monopoly games to see which spaces were the best, I wrote
    conways game of life in the command line for c. I wrote an unoptimized
    n-body gravitational simulation in p5.js. I also had to work part time in
    order to pay for my car. One of my dream jobs was to work at a coach at
    Tempest Freerunning Academy, a place I had been training at since I was
    early in highschool. I didn't get hired right away. I had to work at a
    different gymnastics club first "Le Club Gymnastics". After working there
    for a year I got my opportunity. The pay was lower, and my position would
    drop significantly. But I already knew which path I would rather take.
  </p>
  <h4>UC Santa Cruz</h4>
  <p>
    Fall of 2020 I was accepted to UC Santa Cruz in their Computer Science and
    Game Design program. I worked online for the first year, but fortunately
    the school didn't accept any of my programming from CC so I gained an
    extra year at school. Hooray. My multidisciplinary skills truly shined
    here. I worked as a student podcaster for the UCSC Slugcast. I got to work
    on amazing projects while improving my writin, art, and programming
    skills. I won an award for one of my first game projects at the school
    "Just Focus". Most of all I had a ton of time to work on and develop my
    people skills.
